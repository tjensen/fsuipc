# fsuipc

This project provides a simple Python client class wrapper around the
[FSUIPC](http://www.fsuipc.com/) tool, which allows third-party programs to
interact with the "inner workings" of popular flight simulator software.

Fsuipc is built on top of (and includes) `pyuipc`, by István Váradi
(ivaradi@varadiistvan.hu).

## Installation

The easiest way to install this package is using `pip`:

```
pip install fsuipc
```

Note that fsuipc only supports Windows platforms.
